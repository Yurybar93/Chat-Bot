# Movie Search Telegram Bot

This project is a multilingual Telegram bot designed to search and analyze movies based on keywords, genres, and release years using a MySQL database. The bot supports English, Russian, and German languages and provides features such as keyword search, genre and year search, and viewing popular search queries. To set up this project, ensure you have Python 3.7 or later, a MySQL database server, and a Telegram account with a bot token from BotFather. 

To get started, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-search-bot.git` and navigate into the project directory with `cd movie-search-bot`. Set up your database using the provided `database_setup.sql` file to create the necessary schema. You can execute the SQL file by connecting to your MySQL server and running `mysql -u root -p < database_setup.sql`. Configure your database connection by setting environment variables for `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME`, or create a `config.json` file with these details.

Next, install the project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Set up your Telegram bot by creating one through the BotFather and obtaining your bot token. Add your token as an environment variable using `export TELEGRAM_TOKEN='your_bot_token'`. To run the bot, execute `python bot.py`. Once the bot is running, you can open Telegram and interact with it to search for movies.
